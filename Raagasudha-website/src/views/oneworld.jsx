          One World – One Family is a Unique Festival of Music, Drama and Dance
          at The Glasshouse International Centre for Music. It is a creative
          artistic production unfolds, weaving together mellifluous music,
          mesmerizing dances, legendary dramas, rhythmic drumming, and
          captivating narration. All orchestrated under the revolutionary theme
          of “One World-One Family.” Music transcends boundaries—it speaks the
          universal language of the heart. Whether it emanates from the East or

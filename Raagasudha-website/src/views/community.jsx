          Praveena and Srikailash are very passionate about taking Indian
          Classical Music into the local community. They have started running
          music classes for young children in a primary school in Jesmond,
          Newcastle. Since Praveena has a Master&#39;s degree in Applied
          Behaviour Analysis (ABA) from Queens University, it helps her to take
          music to neuro-diverse students too. This has facilitated our Academy
          in making ties with Autism Able to teach Indian Classical Music in
          South Shields. Another important objective for our Academy is to
          alleviate loneliness which is a major challenge in the UK especially
          amongst the elderly people in south asian communities. Srikailash`s
          expertise in story-writing provides us the opportunity to involve
          elderly people in creating musical dramas thereby helping them keep
          active and thinking in the process.

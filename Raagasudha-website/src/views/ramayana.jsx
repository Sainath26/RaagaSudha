          Our third Pradarshana in June 2023 titled Ramayana is our most
          successful production till date. The story of Rama and Sita was
          beautifully captured with 4 short dramas and 8 mellifluous songs. It
          was performed at The Whitley Bay Playhouse and was watched by 550
          people in total. It was unanimously appreciated, and people were
          thrilled by the presentation and the performances by the artists. Upon
          invitation, Ramayana was taken to London in February 2024. We
          performed at The Bhavan in West Kensington to a sold-out crowd (300)
          followed by a near sell-out at The Royal Court Theatre in Sloanne
          Square, London. In total, the production Ramayana has been watched by
          more than 1250 people so far across three shows in Newcastle and
          London. Our next performances are planned for Diwali at The Hindu
          Temple in Newcastle on the 31 st October and 2 nd November 2024. There
          are invitations from Reading and Qatar for shows which is under
          planning at present.
